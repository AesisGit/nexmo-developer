```

1. Clone this [Github project](https://github.com/nexmo-community/client-sdk-android-tutorial-messaging).
2. Open project in the `Android Studio` - navigate to menu `File -> Open` and select the `kotlin-start` folder from cloned repository.

All filles that will be modified during this tutorial are located in the `app/src/main/java/com/vonage/tutorial/messaging/chat` directory:
