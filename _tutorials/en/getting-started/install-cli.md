# Install the Nexmo CLI

Mark this as optional in that it provides an alternative way of working with your account that we use in a lot of the examples/tutorials within each API.

Explain that it requires Node.js, show how to install, link to `README`.

As an example, show how to perform the previous step (buying a LVN) using the CLI to search for and then buy a number.
